## Overview

Kroo transforms complex construction API data into clean, queryable tables in your data warehouse. This page explains our data modeling methodology and sync strategies.

## Data Modeling Approach

### The Four-Step Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Fetch Raw Data">
Retrieve complete JSON payloads from your construction management APIs
</Step>

<Step title="Flatten Main Resources">
Convert primary objects (RFIs, change orders, etc.) into main database tables
</Step>

<Step title="Extract Nested Data">
Transform nested arrays and objects into separate sub-tables
</Step>

<Step title="Create Relationships">
Link sub-tables back to main tables using defined join keys for easy querying
</Step>
</Steps>

### Real Example: RFI Data Transformation

Here's how we process a typical RFI response from Procore:

**Source API Response:**
```json
{
  "rfi": {
    "id": "abc",
    "due_date": "2024-11-22",
    "status": "open",
    "logs": [
      {
        "created_by": "Jonny",
        "comment": "test"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Generated Tables:**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Main Table: kroo_procore.rfis">
| procore_id (string) | due_date (date) | status (string) |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| "abc"              | 2024-11-22      | "open"         |
</Tab>

<Tab title="Sub-table: kroo_procore.rfi_logs">
| created_by (string) | comment (text) | rfi_id (string) |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Jonny"            | "test"       | "abc"          |
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Key Relationships:**
- `procore_id` in the main table comes from the API's `id` field
- `rfi_id` in the sub-table links back to the main RFI record
- This structure enables easy JOINs for comprehensive reporting

<Info>
**Why This Approach?** This methodology ensures your data warehouse follows relational database best practices while maintaining all the rich detail from your construction management systems.
</Info>

### Understanding Internal Metadata Columns

<Warning>
**Important:** Any column in the Kroo warehouse that starts with an underscore (`_`) is internal metadata added by Kroo's data pipeline. These fields **did not come directly from your source system**.
</Warning>

**Common Internal Metadata Columns:**

- **`_partner_id`** - Internal identifier used by Kroo's sync system
- **`_data_type`** - Internal classification used for pipeline processing
- **`_fivetran_deleted`** - Soft delete flag (exception: this field MUST be used in WHERE clauses)

**Best Practice:** When building queries and views, focus on the business columns that come from your source systems. The only internal metadata column you should regularly use is `_fivetran_deleted = 0` to filter out soft-deleted records.

## Sync Efficiency & Performance

### Smart Sync Strategies

Kroo uses several optimization techniques to ensure reliable, efficient data integration:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Rate Limiting" icon="gauge-high">
**Client-side rate limits with back-off**
- Respects source system availability
- Maximizes sync efficiency
- Prevents API overload
</Card>

<Card title="Incremental Updates" icon="arrow-rotate-right">
**Only sync what's changed**
- Reduces data transfer volume
- Minimizes warehouse load
- Faster sync completion times
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### System Load Management

Our approach minimizes impact on your source systems:

- **Intelligent scheduling** during low-usage periods
- **Gradual back-off** when systems are under load  
- **Monitoring and alerts** for sync health
- **Error recovery** with automatic retry logic

<Info>
**Result:** Your construction management systems continue running smoothly while Kroo keeps your data warehouse up-to-date with the latest project information.

## Data Quality Assurance

### Validation & Consistency

Every sync includes:
- **Schema validation** against expected data structures
- **Data type checking** for consistency
- **Relationship integrity** between main and sub-tables
- **Duplicate detection** and handling

### Monitoring & Alerts

Track data health with:
- Pipeline sync status monitoring
- Data freshness alerts
- Error notifications and resolution
- Performance metrics and trends
