description: "Understanding how Kroo handles deleted records and maintains data integrity in your warehouse."

## Overview

Kroo uses a **soft-delete methodology** to handle records that are deleted in your source construction management systems. This approach prioritizes data integrity and historical tracking over immediate data removal. Deleted records will always be marked with the condition `_fivetran_deleted=true`

## How Soft Deletes Work

When a record is deleted in your source system (like Procore), Kroo:

<Steps>
<Step title="Detects the Deletion">
During the next sync cycle, Kroo identifies that the record no longer exists in the source system
</Step>

<Step title="Marks as Deleted">
Instead of removing the record, Kroo adds a deletion flag (typically `_fivetran_deleted = true`)
</Step>

<Step title="Preserves Historical Data">
The record remains in your warehouse with all original data intact, just flagged as deleted
</Step>

<Step title="Maintains Relationships">
Related records and foreign key relationships remain functional for historical analysis
</Step>
</Steps>

## Database Implementation

### Deletion Flags

Soft-deleted records are identified by special columns:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Standard Flag">
```sql
-- Most common implementation
SELECT * FROM kroo_procore.rfis 
WHERE _fivetran_deleted IS NULL OR _fivetran_deleted = FALSE;
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Timestamp Flag">
```sql
-- Some tables may include deletion timestamps
SELECT * FROM kroo_procore.change_orders 
WHERE _fivetran_deleted_at IS NULL;
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Querying Active Records

To get only active (non-deleted) records in your queries:

```sql
-- Example: Get active RFIs only
SELECT 
    procore_id,
    due_date,
    status,
    created_date
FROM kroo_procore.rfis 
WHERE (_fivetran_deleted IS NULL OR _fivetran_deleted = FALSE)
AND status = 'open';
```

<Info>
**Pro Tip:** Many BI tools and data visualization platforms can automatically filter out soft-deleted records by adding `WHERE _fivetran_deleted IS NULL` to your base queries.

## Working with Soft Deletes

### In Your Reports

When building reports or dashboards:

1. **Default to Active Records**: Filter out deleted records unless specifically analyzing deletions
2. **Historical Analysis**: Include deleted records when analyzing trends over time
3. **Data Validation**: Use deletion flags to identify data quality issues

### In Your Queries

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Active Records Only">
```sql
-- Standard query for current data
SELECT project_name, total_budget
FROM kroo_procore.projects
WHERE _fivetran_deleted IS NULL
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Include Deleted Records">
```sql
-- Historical analysis including deleted records
SELECT 
    project_name, 
    total_budget,
    CASE WHEN _fivetran_deleted THEN 'Deleted' ELSE 'Active' END as status
FROM kroo_procore.projects
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Deletion Analysis">
```sql
-- Analyze deletion patterns
SELECT 
    DATE(updated_at) as deletion_date,
    COUNT(*) as records_deleted
FROM kroo_procore.rfis
WHERE _fivetran_deleted = TRUE
GROUP BY DATE(updated_at)
ORDER BY deletion_date DESC
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Important Considerations

<Card title="Query Performance" icon="gauge-high">
Always include `WHERE _fivetran_deleted IS NULL` in your queries to maintain optimal performance and avoid including unwanted deleted records.
</Card>

<Card title="Storage Impact" icon="hard-drive">
Soft deletes mean your warehouse retains all historical data. Monitor storage usage and work with your team on data archival strategies if needed.

Soft-deleted records containing sensitive information are still present in your warehouse. Consider this for GDPR and other privacy compliance requirements.
