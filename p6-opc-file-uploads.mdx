## Overview

The Oracle P6 connector enables you to upload P6 schedule files to the Kroo platform and sync them to your data warehouse. This guide walks through navigating the Kroo web application to upload P6 schedules and assign them to the appropriate projects.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access Oracle P6 Integration

From the Home page, click on **Oracle P6**. The integration should show a "Connected" status after initial implementation is complete.

  />
</Frame>

### Step 2: Navigate the Integration Home

The **Oracle P6 Integration Home** page displays all previously uploaded P6 files to the Kroo platform.

  />
</Frame>

Key columns on this page:
- **File Name**: The name of the uploaded schedule file
- **Created At**: The date and time of file upload
- **Project**: Active project assignments for each uploaded schedule file
- **Actions**: Options to delete uploaded schedule files as needed

## Uploading P6 Schedule Files

### Step 3: Initiate File Upload

To add a new P6 schedule, click the menu icon (â˜°) in the top-right corner of the page. Select **"Upload Schedule Files"** from the dropdown menu.

### Step 4: Upload Schedule Files

The **Upload Files** section will open, allowing you to upload P6 schedule data.

</Frame>

<Info>
**File Format Requirements**
- Supported file types: `.xer` (standard P6 export format) and `.xml` files
- Maximum of 5 files can be uploaded at once
- For more than 5 files, repeat the upload process (e.g., to upload 8 files, run the process twice)
</Info>

You can upload files using either method:
- Click **"Attach files"** to browse and select files
- Drag and drop files directly into the upload area

### Step 5: Assign Projects

After uploading schedule files (.xer or .xml format), you must associate each schedule with a specific project. This step is crucial for proper data integration.

<Warning>
**Important**: Project assignment enables you to join P6 data with other software and systems using the project's job ID. This is essential for cross-platform data integration.
</Warning>

### Step 6: Process Files

After assigning a project to each uploaded P6 schedule file:
1. Review your selections
2. Click **"Process files"** to complete the upload
3. Files will be processed and synced to your data warehouse

## Additional Features

### Projects Tab

Navigate to the **Projects** tab to view:
- Summary of all active projects
- Associated Project IDs
- Number of schedules uploaded per project
- Filtering and sorting options (click the three-bar icon in column headers)

### Schema Tab

The **Schema** tab provides an interactive visualization of your P6 data structure:
- View table relationships and hierarchies
- Click on relationships to explore parent and child tables
- Understand data connections for building dashboards
- Helpful for PowerBI, Tableau, or Looker implementations

## Using Your P6 Data

Once your P6 data is uploaded and processed:
- Access data through your data warehouse
- Build reports and dashboards in any data visualization software
- Join P6 data with other project systems using the assigned project IDs

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect to Data Warehouse">
Access your P6 tables through your configured data warehouse connection
</Step>

<Step title="Build Visualizations">
Create dashboards in PowerBI, Tableau, Looker, or other BI tools
</Step>

<Step title="Integrate with Other Systems">
Use project IDs to join P6 data with Procore, Autodesk, and other platforms
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Upload updated schedule files regularly to maintain current data
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent file naming conventions for easier tracking
3. **Project Assignment**: Always assign the correct project before processing files
4. **Batch Processing**: Upload up to 5 files at once for efficiency
