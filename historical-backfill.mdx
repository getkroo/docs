description: "Learn how to request historical data backfill for inactive or completed projects in Kroo."
---

## Overview

By default, Kroo synchronizes data only for **active projects** to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary data processing. However, you may need historical data from completed or inactive projects for reporting, analysis, or compliance purposes.

## What is Historical Backfill?

Historical backfill is the process of retroactively importing data from:

- **Completed projects** that were finished before Kroo integration
- **Inactive projects** that are no longer actively managed
- **Archived data** from specific time periods
- **Legacy systems** being migrated to new platforms

<Info>
**Important:** Historical backfill is a one-time process that requires coordination with the Kroo implementation team to ensure data integrity and optimal performance.
