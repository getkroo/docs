## Overview

While Kroo automatically syncs your data on a regular schedule, there are times when you need the latest information immediately. The manual refresh feature allows you to trigger an on-demand sync for specific integrations.

<Info>
**Refresh Limit:** Manual refreshes are limited to **once per day per integration** to prevent system overload and maintain performance for all users.
</Info>

## How to Manually Refresh Data

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Kroo Dashboard">
Log into your Kroo application and navigate to the **Home Page**
</Step>

<Step title="Open Integrations Manager">
Click on the **Manage Integrations** tab to view all your connected systems
</Step>

<Step title="Select Integration">
Find and click on the integration you want to refresh (e.g., Procore, other connected systems)
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Specific Endpoint">
Expand the accordion for the specific data type or endpoint you need to sync
</Step>

<Step title="Trigger Manual Sync">
Click the **Trigger Manual Sync** button to start the refresh process
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor Progress">
Watch for confirmation that the sync has started and monitor for completion
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Daily Limit:** Remember that each integration can only be manually refreshed once per 24-hour period. Plan accordingly for your most critical data needs.
</Warning>

## What Happens During Manual Refresh

When you trigger a manual sync:

1. **Priority Processing** - Your request goes to the front of the sync queue
2. **Incremental Update** - Only new or changed data is pulled (not a full resync)
3. **Real-time Monitoring** - You can track the sync progress in the dashboard
4. **Validation Checks** - Data quality validation runs automatically
5. **Completion Notification** - You'll see confirmation when the sync completes

## Expected Sync Times

Typical manual refresh completion times:

- **Small datasets** (< 1,000 records): 2-5 minutes
- **Medium datasets** (1,000-10,000 records): 5-15 minutes  
- **Large datasets** (> 10,000 records): 15-30 minutes

<Info>
**Sync Time Factors:** Actual sync times depend on data volume, API response times from your source system, and current system load.

## Troubleshooting Manual Refresh

### Common Issues

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Button Grayed Out">
**Possible Causes:**
- Already used today's manual refresh
- Sync currently in progress
- Integration temporarily disabled

**Solution:** Wait for scheduled sync or contact support if urgent
</Tab>

<Tab title="Sync Takes Too Long">
**Possible Causes:**
- Large data volume
- Source system performance issues
- Network connectivity problems

**Solution:** Wait for completion or contact support after 45 minutes
</Tab>

<Tab title="Sync Fails">
**Possible Causes:**
- Source system unavailable
- Authentication issues
- Data validation errors

**Solution:** Try again in 15 minutes, or contact support with error details

## Alternative: Check Pipeline Status

If you can't perform a manual refresh, you can still monitor your data freshness:

Set up real-time monitoring to track when your data was last synced and get alerts for stale data.
